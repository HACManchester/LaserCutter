# TODO

  * Update the Basic Laser useage docs using the Manchester Hacspace Wiki for the orange laser cutter <br>
    Current docs are old for the blue laser
  * Add more images for those docs
  * Update the CSS so that the header doesn't expand on mobile
  * Update the CSS so that the overall width isn't limited
  * Additional Markdown plugins for arrows / icons
  * Can we import a 3D / WebGL model of the laser cutter for the main index?
  * Double sided boards via FlatCAM / Alignment Holes
