List of experimental things to try

## Cermark

Cermark appears to be a type of paint that once applied to metal will cause it to be etched once a laser is fired at it.
The only down side is that it appears to be fairly expensive

One approach might be Isopropyl and Plaster

## Conductive Paint

One idea might be to experiment with conductive paint and copper plating on a laser friendly board
