They sell some perspex / bits of wood, and glass paint for experimenting with pcb solder masks

## Special Materials / Cutting

### Burnable Materials / Mahogany

With some types of material one approach to cutting is to use a low power setting but with multiple passes <br>
However one thing to watch out for is that you may end up with a build up of carbon along the cut line

### Acrylic

One approach to making a 3D thing is to use Acrylic then glue the parts together. <br>
3mm Acrylic A4 size is fairly cheap from Fred Aldous about about 3 pound

Acrylic glue appears to work by softening both sides and melting them together.
But it's important to use sand paper fine grit, or perhaps the belt sander to get a smooth edge first
