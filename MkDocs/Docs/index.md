-----------------
| If the laser cutter does **anything** out of the ordinary please make sure it's reported to a laser maintainer. If the response is "please put the out of order sign on the cutter" then do that. **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX THE CUTTER YOURSELF.** If it is clearly not functioning, put the out of order sign on it and then report it. We will fix it as soon as possible. |
