# Laser Cutter

The Hackspace laser cutter is only to be used by those who have received an induction,
however there's lots you need to do before you get anywhere near the actual hardware

[Book an induction](http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Laser_Cutter/inductions)  (members only - sorry).

  * **Please refrain from using the laser cutter between 8am and 3pm Monday to Friday as the fumes are causing one of our neighbours to get migraines.** <br>
  * If you do need to use the laser cutter between these times, please knock on the door of Lashes Limited and let them know, so they can make sure their windows are closed etc
