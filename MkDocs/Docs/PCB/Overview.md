# Overview

For homebrew PCB's there are a few different approaches.
This includes the toner transfer / iron method, the toner transfer / Laminator approach (which is more accurate).

One approach is to use a laser cutter to remove paint from a Copper board, then etch the board.
This can however require a few tricks to get it right.
